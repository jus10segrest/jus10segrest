Hi, I’m Justin Segrest,
I am a current Sports Science Intern at Marian University interested in learning more about coding and analyzing data.
I love basketball and football and want to collaborate and learn more about analyzing game data and season metrics to understand the game more.

I can be reached at jus10segrest@gmail.com.
